## Homework (due Tuesday 12/6)

Build on top of the favorite things list app (2_event_delegation_lab folder) to store your initial favorite things data in a JavaScript object 
and interact with the object whenever the user interacts with the DOM.

1. Use Handlebars to add any the initial data as well as any new DOM content.

2. Store all of your data in a `faves` object.

3. Organize your code so your app logic is DRY.

4. Bonus: create a method you can reference in your app to compile your data to Handlebars templates, instead of relying on doing this every 
time you need to add a DOM object.
